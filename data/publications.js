        "date":"November, 2016",
        "summary":"This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:<ul><li>Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.</li><li>Favor deep end-to-end accomplishments over broad but incremental steps forward. Focus on taking the right teams far before encouraging broad adoption.</li><li>Centralize the platforms and tools that your teams shouldn’t be thinking about. Provide foundational services/commodities and let teams stay on purpose.</li><li>Incorporate contributions from everyone; don’t stifle autonomy. Stay open to new ways of working.</li><li>Challenge security policies, but respect intentions. Find new ways to enforce concerns without abandoning precaution.</li></ul>",

        "summary":"My team is at the heart of that journey providing the major platforms and tooling that support/enable cloud adoption. But providing tools is never enough, and I’ve been using the analogy of a 3-legged stool to convey this challenge across our company. It’s been a successful model for us, teams using our enterprise pipelines have shifted about 80% of their workloads to one of our strategic cloud targets.",
