Recently I have been attempting to build graphs in PHP. I was shocked by the lack of Object-Oriented classes to handle this. It just seems that dynamic graphing is a pretty common need, yet not much in the way of open source solutions. I have settled for a nifty flash solution called [_Open Fash Chart_](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fteethgrinder.co.uk%2Fopen-flash-chart%2F&ei=QoAzSIjoKI2seaHExO8G&usg=AFQjCNHhH4HeV617YM1pOwm5Ew3oqiHSyw&sig2=9dYWZImuokV9PBHrFVutkg "Check out OFC") . The animations are smooth and will work, I just dislike loading sites with cumbersome applets that require plugins. I am still looking for an all server side / javascript solution.
