Wow.

I am just awed by the support and turnout from this community.  You all just totally blew me away.

Thanks for everyone who voted, read, shared, attened, and asked.  While the current board still needs to approve my election next month for my term beginning July I'm not going to lose any momentum. I already have a list of things to research and understand better, and I look forward to start building relationships with the team.
