### ADV standard equipment

These are items I consider as a must-have for any adventure riding that has my bike where a tow won't go.

#### In case of emergency...

- [ ] toolkit (bike specific)
- [ ] rope (4-5mm paracord works great 50+ feet)
- [ ] crevasse pulleys 2x (small, split open for mid-line use)
- [ ] duct tape
- [ ] nylon zip ties


#### Safety
- [ ] GPS messenger
- [ ] first aid
- [ ] FRS radios (one-per rider)



### camping specific

These items are specific to camping.  I am trying to be frugal, but not minimalist.  

#### shelter & comfort (everybody)

- [ ] hammock (with bug net, rain fly, quilt, way smaller than tents, similar price)
- [ ] sleeping bag
- [ ] camp chair (not essential, but nearly so)

#### Fire and Food
- [ ] utensil set per rider (spoon/fork combo FTW!)
- [ ] camp stove
- [ ] stove fuel
- [ ] bear bag for any food (ensure you have enough rope!)
- [ ] fatwood or firestarter (optional if you want fire, dont plan to cook with it)

#### Tools and Tricks
- [ ] headlamp / flashlight
- [ ] pocketknife/multifunction
- [ ] water filtration or containers (plan for 4L / night / rider )
- [ ] personal water bottles or camelbaks

#### Going rugged?
- [ ] mini shovel ('the duece' is cheap, small, and light)
- [ ] mini hatchet for firewood (optional if you want fire, dont plan to cook with it)


### Shopping

These items are maybe around the house, but likely to need a run to the store prior to leaving or camping.


- [ ] garbage bags
- [ ] water ( plan for 4L / night / rider )
- [ ] 'power' snacks (granola bars, meat sticks, small and protien packed)
- [ ] bug spray
- [ ] hand wipes / wet wipes
- [ ] food - 2 ready to eat meals per day per rider
- [ ] coffee - enough for 1 brew / day
