I've finally tapped my brother to join me for a off-road motorcycle camping adventure. 

<!--more-->

 Sure, we've already done a couple "campsite camping" trips this season, pay for a site, access to toilets and showers, running potable water, etc.  But **[primitive camping](https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/41282.html)** away from home, and without running water requires considerably more preperation.

### What is Moto Camping

For those who have never _moto-camped_ or **camped from your motorcycle**, it is important to know it's much closer to backpacking than car-camping.    

- Space is limited - no big tents, camp stoves, or coolers here
- Remote places - carry in, carry out - be prepared
- No amenities - no showers or loos out here
- Bears / wildlife - no car to lock food in, so know your bear-bag skills

Unlike backpacking though:

- Many opt to feed at road-side restaurants, not camp cooked meals
- Assuming you have fuel, supplies are never _so_ far off
- Bikes are batteries, lights, and chargers - so extra batteries less critical


### Finding the right location

#### Selecting your site

**For first times I actually highly-encourage a visit to a managed campsite** with anmenities -- be it private like KOA or State-run.  It's  nice way to get used to the experience, learn what you need and don't need all with the comfort and knowledge of running water and first-aid is nearby.

**Pick somewhere close.**  If you forget an extra blanket, or need more water than you thought, better not be 200 miles from home.

**Pick somewhere interesting** The benefit of moto-camping over car camping is access. We can get these bikes many places that even a formible off-road vehicle might not reach.  So choose a spot of beauty or activities that interest you!

#### Our site - Deer River State Park

In northern NY, west of Malone are a collection of smaller tends with awesome state parks all around.  We chose Deer River for it's seclusion and numerous primitive sites managed by DEC.

A few campsites to choose from, we'll first explore the area.

### Preparing supplies

As I mentioned this is my first motorcycle camping trip of the season (and also past 6, lol) so I've really not had any of our camping gear together.  To help get my head straight I created a [pre-trip moto camping supply list]({{< ref "supplies.md" >}})

#### Nice-essities

Well not strictly required, here are a few items I found worth the extra hassle to find and pack!

##### Short camp chair 

Yes, yes - I _could_ sit on the ground, on my bike, pull of panniers, etc.  But I found that being able to sit comfortably after long day of riding is just really nice, and worth the hassle. They're are models for every budget.

{{< imgresize "assets/chairsaddlebag.jpg" "600x400" "This chair is size of water bottle and fits in saddlebags" >}}

**Budget Hunters:**
Found this on sale for $20 at a local outdoor equipment store. It fits at the bottom of my soft panniers no problem, and opens to a nice (though slightly undersized) lounger.

##### Mini Stove / Coffee Press

This is probably one of the best backpacking inventions ever.  A portable camp stove that fits the fuel & burner inside the pot.  MSR and JetBoil are the 2 leading names here.  I opted for a JetBoil because it had built-in coffee press!

{{< imgresize "assets/jetflash.jpeg" "400x300" "Coffee!!!" >}}
{{< imgresize "assets/jetboil-compactness.jpeg" "400x300" "Even with french press it all fits inside!" >}}

Even with coffee press, the fuel, burner and stand all fit inside.

**Budget Hunters:** skip the burner, fuel, coffee, and food and just plan local eateries to visit. Just be sure to confirm hours/openings in advance!

##### Hammock System / Tent

Yes, you can find compact tents meant for backpacking that are lighter and shorter.  They are also wicked expensive.

I opted for a $150 tent/screen/rainfly combo that also **eliminates the need for a sleeping pad** since I am well above any rocks and roots.


{{< imgresize "assets/hammocksetup.jpeg" "400x300" "Hammock suspended from trees with rainfly and bug net." >}}

{{< imgresize "assets/hammockpacked.jpeg" "400x300" "Packs up portable! About the size of 2-3 water bottles." >}}

Best of all it is about the size of my stove, and only weighs a couple of pounds. 

**Budget Hunters:**  Budget hunters can find a setup as low as $60 on wayfair/outlet sites, or keep an eye on "used gear" sales.  I highly recommend hammock over tent though!


#### The Shopping

Aside from the big fixed items, you'll likely need to do some shopping to get a few key supplies.

- freeze-dried or dehydrated meals
- camp stove fuel
- hand wipes/wet wipes
- bug spray
- Protein bars / protein rich snacks

### Packing Up

Cool, now we've spent a bunch of money and our significant other is eyeing our pile of supplies with increasing skepticism.

**Time to get our bikes loaded up!**

#### Final Checklist

I suggest packing up the day(s) before just to make sure you have everything, and that it fits.  If you need supplies, bungees, etc better to find out with time to spare.

I use a simple [moto camping checklist]({{<ref "checklist.md" >}}) to finish any shopping and start to organize my items into where they will be packed and or attached to my bike.

##### Lay it all out

Easiest way to take inventory, confirm supplies, and start to get a sense of the Tetris game we're about to play is to just lay it all out on the ground.  (hey let's bring that tarp too!)

**take a breath** we can do this.
