I've finally tapped my brother to join me for a off-road motorcycle camping adventure. 

<!--more-->

 Sure, we've already done a couple "campsite camping" trips this season, pay for a site, access to toilets and showers, running potable water, etc.  But this is our first **[primitive camping](https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/41282.html)** of the year. We'll be a few hundred miles form home without running water -- so requires considerably more preperation.  And me writing it down is keeping me sane.

### What is Moto Camping

_Moto-camping_ is simply **camping from your motorcycle**, but it is important to know it's much closer to backpacking than car-camping.    

- Space is limited - no big tents, camp stoves, or coolers here
- Remote places - carry in, carry out - be prepared
- No amenities - no showers or loos out here
- Bears / wildlife - no car to lock food in, so know your bear-bag skills

Unlike backpacking though:

- Many opt to feed at road-side restaurants, not camp cooked meals
- Assuming you have fuel, supplies are never _so_ far off
- Bikes are batteries, lights, and chargers - so extra batteries less critical


### Finding the right location

#### Selecting your 1st site

**For first time I actually chose a visit to a managed campsite** with anmenities -- in my case a local state campground.  It's  nice way to get used to the experience, learn what you need and don't need all with the comfort and knowledge of running water and first-aid is nearby.

**I wanted somewhere close.**  If we forget an extra blanket, or need more water than  thought, better not be 200 miles from home.

**Now I want somewhere interesting.** The benefit of moto-camping over car camping is access. We can get these bikes many places that even a formible off-road vehicle might not reach.  So now it's time to choose a spot of beauty or activities that interest us!

#### Our site - Deer River State Park

In northern NY, west of Malone are a collection of smaller tends with awesome state parks all around.  We chose Deer River for it's seclusion and numerous primitive sites managed by DEC.

A few campsites to choose from, we'll first explore the area.

### Preparing supplies

As I mentioned this is my first motorcycle camping trip of the season (and also since having my daughter 6 years ago, lol) so I've really not kept any of our camping gear together.  To help get my head straight I created a [pre-trip moto camping supply list]({{< ref "supplies.md" >}}) to shop for anything missing.

#### Nice-essities

Beyond the basics, and certainly not strictly required, here are a few items I found worth the extra hassle to find and pack!

##### Short camp chair 

Yes, yes - I _could_ sit on the ground, on my bike, pull of panniers, etc.  But I found that being able to sit comfortably after long day of riding is just really nice, and worth the hassle. They're are models for every budget.

**Budget Hunters:**
Found this on sale for $20 at a local outdoor equipment store. It fits at the bottom of my soft panniers no problem, and opens to a nice (though slightly undersized) lounger.

##### Mini Stove / Coffee Press

This is probably one of the best backpacking inventions ever.  A portable camp stove that fits the fuel & burner inside the pot.  MSR and JetBoil are the 2 leading names here.  I opted for a [JetBoil with a built-in coffee press](https://amzn.to/3mjhhpw)!

{{< imgresize "assets/jetflash.jpeg" "400x300" "Coffee!!!" >}}
{{< imgresize "assets/jetboil-compactness.jpeg" "400x300" "Even with french press it all fits inside!" >}}

Even with coffee press, the fuel, burner and stand all fit inside.

**Budget Hunters:** skip the burner, fuel, coffee, and food and just plan local eateries to visit. Just be sure to confirm hours/openings in advance!

##### Hammock System / Tent

Yes, we can find and buy compact tents meant for backpacking that are lighter and shorter.  They are also wicked expensive.

I opted for a $150 tent/screen/rainfly combo that also **eliminates the need for a sleeping pad** since I am well above any rocks and roots.
`(hammock + bag) < (tent + bag + pad)`


{{< imgresize "assets/hammocksetup.jpeg" "400x300" "Hammock suspended from trees with rainfly and bug net." >}}

{{< imgresize "assets/hammockpacked.jpeg" "400x300" "Packs up portable! About the size of 2-3 water bottles." >}}

Best of all it is about the size of my stove, and only weighs a couple of pounds. 

**Budget Hunters:**  Budget hunters can find [hammock tent combo kits as low as $60](https://amzn.to/3mjhhpw) on amazon/wayfair/outlet sites, or keep an eye on "used gear" sales.  


#### The Shopping

Aside from the big fixed items, we'll need to do some shopping to get a few key supplies.

- freeze-dried or dehydrated meals
- camp stove fuel
- hand wipes/wet wipes
- bug spray
- Protein bars / protein rich snacks

### Packing Up

Cool, now we've spent a bunch of money and our significant other is eyeing our pile of supplies with increasing skepticism.

**Time to get our bikes loaded up!**

#### Final steps - lay it all out


**take a breath** we can do this.

I suggest packing up the day(s) before just to make sure we have everything, and that it fits.  If we need supplies, bungees, etc better to find out with time to spare.

I use a simple [moto camping checklist]({{<ref "checklist.md" >}}) to finish any shopping and start to organize my items into where they will be packed and or attached to my bike.

  [ photo of items laid out ]

Easiest way to take inventory, confirm supplies, and start to get a sense of the Tetris game we're about to play is to just lay it all out on the ground.  (hey let's bring that tarp too!)


**Also keep in mind we need to get to & from the site -- with dry gear.**  So anything that isn't going into a waterproof pannier will need its own protection.

In my case my beastly old sleeping bag is the sole item that won't be inside a [waterproof rollup saddlebag](https://amzn.to/37SnBfu).  I started doing this trick years ago when canoe camping, and just hoping it holds up here :grimmace:


1. remove bag from stuff sack
2. place garbage bag inside stuff sack as liner
3. roll and place sleeping bag (no super agressive stuffin now K?)
4. Leaving the top of the garbage bag open, gently compress, expelling air
5. cinch stuff sack down around bag, and knot or fold it over.

** don't forget to adjust your motorcycle's sag for all the extra weight! **
