PLANNED RIDE: Here's the plan, re-visit CR-26 (full tank of gas this time!) and then turn southwest down Kushaqua-Mud Pond road down into Onchiota before returning eastward.

Womp Womp! (sad trumpet)

I got about 2 miles down kushaqua mud-pond rd only to find the bridge crossing Saranac river that feeds Mud Pond was closed!

I spent some time looking for an alternate route, **but no cell-service and a rather deep river-crossing told my better senses to turn back**.

This detour took me down RT 3 west further to Vermontville where I picked up the scent on Oreogn Plains Rd. A few miles south of Onchiota.

Fortunately still a beautiful day and a great ride.

I was also pleased to notice my comfort and technical abilities much improved on the long stretches of loose gravel roads.  Thanks to [this great video from MotoTrek on cornering on gravel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8rywrWuAqw).


### Takeaways

I learned a few things on this trip.

1) I need an ADV buddy. I dumped my bike on a sharp hill climb when looking for an alternate route, and spent a good 45 minutes heaving and sweating to turn it around and ride it out of a ditch.
2) I need a good set of paper maps for the area.
3) I am giving a winch or block-and-tackle set a serious considering.
