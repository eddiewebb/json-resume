How far will your car go on "E"?

Once the little light pops on you know your first priority is a fill-up at the nearest station.

Now I've pushed my car knowing "Empty" means you usually have 1-2 gallons or more left.. atleast 30 miles.  


But when the indicator light came on my bike this weekend I knew my little tank would not be so generous... or would it?

I was about 90 minutes into my ride when the light came on just as a I turned off a rural county road onto an even more rural route.  Checking the map it was ~15 miles back to the last town, and ~10 miles to the next.  I know the bike will get 15 miles on empty, so I pressed on.


The next town was a miss. Nothing more than paved roads. Checking the map again, and searching for gas stations my heart dropped atleast another 12 miles in the wrong direction. HEading home there was one about 20 miles out.

Optimism in hear I assumed this now major highway would have some little place that no one bothered to mark on my GPS.

35 miles on empty now, I must be running on fumes.  I'm now scanning every house I pass (which are all to infrequent) for a lawn-mower, atv, or anything with a gas can I could beg for.

43 miles on empty -- finally! a shop, oh.. no pumps.

Wait, WAIT that is an old hand-pump -- is it show or functional?  No option but to try!

Cash only, hand-cranked spinning wheels quickly brought my tank to full again.  The anxiety of leaving my bike and walking lord knows how far fades, I can finally resume taking in the scenery, and gosh what a ride.
