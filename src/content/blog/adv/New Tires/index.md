This is long overdue for me. I've been eyeing some nice 50/50 tires since I got this bike several years ago. I've had Mitas E-07 set sitting in my garage for 3 months.  This weekend I finally swapped in my new tires, and dit it myself!
<!--more-->

I've been too nervous to do this, but my preferred shop here is temporarily closed, other shops want $50 or more a tire, insane.  So I finally caved and took it on myself.

Now I'm actually not a _total_ novice.  I probabky changed hundreds of bicycle tires as a kid, but less than a handful of dirt bike tires, but all with tubes.  I've never had to break a bead or make one, so this was a big deal.  I started with the front because the axle itself is easier to remove, and the tire being a bit smaller would be easier I thought.

It was hell.  

I got the old one off easily, and was jazzed.  I got the first half of the new one on super fast.  I was 70% on the last side when the opposite side kept pulling out of the channel, and making it impossible to stretch the last side over.  Finally a bit more windex and kneeling on the opposite side and I popped it on, with minimal damage to my rim (there was damage).

I'm proud at this point because A) I did it (or one) and B) I only used tools from my roadside kit!

Looks good! 

Although I thought I almost lost a thumb when it got trapped between the rubber and rim getting the last of the last side over.  I was able to use an iron and pry it up and out. Hurt like hell, but no major damage.

Next up, rear tire with chains and alignment added to the fun!

I took a break before the back tires and let them cook in the sun to warm up.

Holy goodness what a difference that made.  I got through the new back tire in under 10 minutes, it slide right on, the last 80% WAS _still_ very stiff and tight, but came over much easier than the front.

My BMW has a nice little indicator to keep the left&right side equal distance. So just measures the sag of chain, noted the depth, and adjusted the other side to match.

Both tires beaded, sounded like gunshots, what a heart jump that was, but I was still nervous if they set.  A few more parnoid checks with windex and I confirmed everything was sealed up -- and looking tough!

Father's Day not being until tomrorow my family was kind enough to let me take a quick test ride, and I think these tires are going to be a lot of fun!

And now as I write this I have a small heart attack noticing the front and rear treads appear to be in opposite directions -- which tire did I put on wrong?!?

Turns out neither, the purpose of the tread is a bit different on front and back. The back tire is pushing forward against the tarmac, while the front is _being_ pushed into it.  So the pattern on front is focused on diverting the forwward momentum to the sides to stear, so it makes sense they oppose.  You can google some good articles on this, and pay attention to the labels on your tires.
