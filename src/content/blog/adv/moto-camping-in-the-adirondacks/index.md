I've finally tapped my brother to join me for a off-road motorcycle camping adventure. 

<!--more-->

 Sure, we've already done a couple "campsite camping" trips this season, pay for a site, access to toilets and showers, running potable water, etc.  But this is our first **[primitive camping](https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/41282.html)** of the year. We'll be a few hundred miles form home without running water -- so requires considerably more preperation.  And me writing it down is keeping me sane.

### What is Moto Camping

_Moto-camping_ is simply **camping from your motorcycle**, but it is important to know it's much closer to backpacking than car-camping.    

- Space is limited - no big tents, camp stoves, or coolers here
- Remote places - carry in, carry out - be prepared
- No amenities - no showers or loos out here
- Bears / wildlife - no car to lock food in, so know your bear-bag skills

Unlike backpacking though:

- Many opt to feed at road-side restaurants, not camp cooked meals
- Assuming you have fuel, supplies are never _so_ far off
- Bikes are batteries, lights, and chargers - so extra batteries less critical


### Finding the right location

#### Selecting our 1st site

**For first time I actually chose a visit to a managed campsite** with anmenities -- in my case a local state campground.  It's  nice way to get used to the experience, learn what you need and don't need all with the comfort and knowledge of running water and first-aid is nearby.

**I wanted somewhere close.**  If we forget an extra blanket, or need more water than  thought, better not be 200 miles from home.

**Now I want somewhere interesting.** The benefit of moto-camping over car camping is access. We can get these bikes many places that even a formible off-road vehicle might not reach.  So now it's time to choose a spot of beauty or activities that interest us!

#### Our target site - Deer River State Park

In northern NY, west of Malone are a collection of smaller tends with awesome state parks all around.  We chose Deer River for it's seclusion and numerous primitive sites managed by DEC.

A few campsites to choose from, we'll first explore the area.

### Preparing supplies

As I mentioned this is my first motorcycle camping trip of the season (and also since having my daughter 6 years ago, lol) so I've really not kept any of our camping gear together.  To help get my head straight I created a [pre-trip moto camping supply list](https://www.notion.so/eddiewebb/Motorcycle-Camping-Supply-List-ada0af28553f42d58b2f4bc06d8a2075) to shop for anything missing.

#### Nice-essities

Beyond the basics, and certainly not strictly required, here are a few items I found worth the extra hassle to find and pack!

##### Short camp chair 

Yes, yes - I _could_ sit on the ground, on my bike, pull of panniers, etc.  But I found that being able to sit comfortably after long day of riding is just really nice, and worth the hassle. They're are models for every budget.

**Budget Hunters:**
Found this on sale for $20 at a local outdoor equipment store. It fits at the bottom of my soft panniers no problem, and opens to a nice (though slightly undersized) lounger.

##### Mini Stove / Coffee Press

This is probably one of the best backpacking inventions ever.  A portable camp stove that fits the fuel & burner inside the pot.  MSR and JetBoil are the 2 leading names here.  I opted for a [JetBoil with a built-in coffee press](https://amzn.to/3mjhhpw)!

{{< imgresize "assets/jetflash.jpeg" "400x300" "Coffee!!!" >}}
{{< imgresize "assets/jetboil-compactness.jpeg" "400x300" "Even with french press it all fits inside!" >}}

Even with coffee press, the fuel, burner and stand all fit inside.

**Budget Hunters:** skip the burner, fuel, coffee, and food and just plan local eateries to visit. Just be sure to confirm hours/openings in advance!

##### Hammock System / Tent

Yes, we can find and buy compact tents meant for backpacking that are lighter and shorter.  They are also wicked expensive.

I opted for a $150 tent/screen/rainfly combo that also **eliminates the need for a sleeping pad** since I am well above any rocks and roots.
`(hammock + bag) < (tent + bag + pad)`

{{< imgresize "assets/hammockpacked.jpeg" "400x300" "Packs up portable! About the size of 2-3 water bottles." >}}

Best of all it is about the size of my stove, and only weighs a couple of pounds. 

**Budget Hunters:**  Budget hunters can find [hammock tent combo kits as low as $60](https://amzn.to/3mjhhpw) on amazon/wayfair/outlet sites, or keep an eye on "used gear" sales.  


#### The Shopping

Aside from the big fixed items, we'll need to do some shopping to get a few key supplies.

- freeze-dried or dehydrated meals
- camp stove fuel
- hand wipes/wet wipes
- bug spray
- Protein bars / protein rich snacks

### Packing Up

_Cool, now we've spent a bunch of money and our significant other is eyeing our pile of supplies with increasing skepticism._

**Time to get our bikes loaded up!**

I was surprised to find my nelson-rigg saddlebags paired with the hard panniers on my brothers bike were totally sufficient for all of our goods, aside from sleeping bags.

** don't forget to adjust your motorcycle's sag for all the extra weight! **
