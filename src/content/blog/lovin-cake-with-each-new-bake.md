This post is about CakePHP, this sweet lil' framework for the PHP engine. The package is provided from an open source community of very supportive developers. Those already familar with the PHP community know why that is. Cake basically wraps tons of powerful classes into a Model-Controller-View methodology of development. Need a Customer Relationship Manager prototype in 3 weeks? No sweat. Using Cakes classes would have that CRM prototype up and running in less than 2 weeks (22.5 hrs). That is, if you hired me to push it out :). Like any language other developers could be much faster or slower. [Wanna see it?](http://crm.edwardawebb.com "Demo Eddie's CRM prototyp.") Now obviously CRM's don't have register pages, they have admin user management pages. So you can use '_jcopie_' with the password '_password_'' to get in. Far beyond the CRM is a new project I'm working on. It is still sorta under wraps, but I'll let you know that it takes advantage of AJAX sorting and record navigation as well as other little tricks to navigation much smoother. As soon as it does go public, you'll be the first to know.
