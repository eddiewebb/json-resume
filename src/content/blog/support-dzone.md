I have had more than a few friends and websites point me to DZone as a source for articles and reference material. I love the idea of free PDF cheat-sheets for just about any language or technology, but there is a major "_gotcha_":

**Postal addresses, and other personally identifying information and data**, will be used to promote DZone and other DZone companies products and services, and may be **rented and/or licensed to selected outside firms for promotional purposes**. Offers for which the personally identifying information and data are rented and/or licensed for use and the users are required to target their offers carefully.

**Telephone numbers of DZone users** may be used by DZone, affiliates and it's advertisers for promotional purposes. **DZone may rent and/or license for use phone numbers to selected outside firms for promotional purposes.** Offers for which the numbers are rented and/or licensed for use are required to target their offers carefully.

When you provide **your email address** to us, you agree to receive email from DZone and its sister DZone companies. We allow users to "opt-out" of receiving email from outside firms, however, when email information is collected and with each email use of the user’s address you can individually "opt-out" of receiving further e-mail from outside firms, DZone and its sister DZone companies. If a user does not choose to "opt out" at the time the email address is collected, or does not respond to the questions concerning how we may use their email address, **the address may be rented and/or licensed for use to outside firms.**

That is taken directly from [DZone's Privacy Policy](http://refcardz.dzone.com/page/privacy "DZone's Privacy Policy states their will to rent and license your personal information."), and although not illegal by any means, is a major nuisance nonetheless. Translation: DZone reserves the right to earn income (in addition to the advertisements) by adding your private information to mailing lists and call lists.  Anyone who has been added to a list like this in the past knows the drill -- once you get on one, your information gets passed around like a dirty dollar bill.  **Soon you're receiving mailers for credit cards, and phone calls for auto warranties.   Super!**
