Everyone is posting the video that shows a rooted HTC EVO, but no one has details. **The main reason is a lack of information for the hack author themselves**.. **But to understand from the source why the details aren't forthcoming**, see [this forum post that highlights the details](http://evounlocked.com/rooting-and-imaging-f2/root-the-htc-evo-t1.html "Details for the HTC EVO root hack, including a link to the author site."), and links to the hacker's site. **Here's the short** \- we will be waiting until at least the public release of Froyo (Android 2.2) on the EVO before the root hack goes public.
