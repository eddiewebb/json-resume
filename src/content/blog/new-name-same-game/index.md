I've pushed some changes to this site to reflect an important change - my name!

Moving forward I will be using the surname Webbinaro, which is the marriage of my wife's family name and my own.

```
Webb + Rendinaro = Webbinaro
```

Although COVID-19 has slowed our process with the courts a bit, I'm updating my presence here and on all my social media and business profiles to reflect my new name.

But don't worry, I promise that Eddie Webbinaro is just as passionate about helping teams of every shape and size with awesome tools and culture of learning.

To recap, Eddie Webb is further forth known as Eddie Webbinaro. Given my Eddie/Edward and intermiten inclusion of middle name, I now have 8 aliases. 

```
Eddie Webb
Eddie Arthur Webb # never use this
Edward Webb
Edward Arthur Webb #classic
Eddie Webbinaro
Eddie Arthur Webbinaro #meh
Edward Webbinaro 
Edward Arthur Webbinaro 
```

Woah, `Edward Arthur Webbinaro` - that's almost as good as Max Powers, but just call me Eddie... Webbinaro. :D
