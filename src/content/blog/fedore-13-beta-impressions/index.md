I was tempted to run with the Fedora 13 Alpha, but just found out this morning that **Fedora 13 Beta RC1 is publicly available**.  Fedora 11 was still treating me fine. But I was curious to see the changes, so I ran a complete re-image of my machine.   What did I find?

### The Installation

The installation looked good and went smooth.  Still doesn't support wlan authentication during install :( [![Pre-Release Warning Screen](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010-03-28-10.11.58-300x225.jpg "Pre-Release Warning")](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010-03-28-10.11.58.jpg) \[caption id="attachment_696" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="And it begins.."\][![Install begins](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010-03-28-10.22.14-300x225.jpg "Install begins")](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010-03-28-10.22.14.jpg)\[/caption\]  The installation lasted about 45 minutes start to finish. Ahhhh After the install the CD drive kicked open, and the screen slowly died, fading from color to black very slowly.  It stayed totally black for several minutes before I restarted.

### First Looks

Looks good!

### Features

KDE 4, updated KNetwork Applet and hardware management look promising. \

### Device Support

Although my Fedora 11 install went nicely, I still had to finagle things to get the video card performing and get any sound or video through my hdmi.  I hoped that Fedora 13 would bring better hardware support for laptops. Sound - Check. Webcam - Check. HDMI -

### Overall Impressions

Still a bit of concerns, my fan control seems to be running high, and the hdmi sound does not work,, video takes some tinkering.
