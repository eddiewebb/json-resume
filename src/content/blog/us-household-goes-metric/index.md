I feel fortunate that my employer is based in Australia.  It's continued to push me to re-evaluate my ehtnocentric view of the world.

One small example was a recent thread in our "Makers" channel discussing where and when we see imperial and metric measures used. 

Many of my Aussie co-workers pointed out they haven't needed to touch the _imperial spanners_ (That's a "standard wrench" for my American readers)  that their fathers left them ages ago. As my side of the world came round to face the sun some of them were wondering "Is the US really _that_ averse to metric? Don't they sometimes use both types of measures?"

**Turns out the United States is already a "metric nation"** and has been since 1880's or 1970's depending on your interpretation.  

**So if the U.S. Government is metric, why isn't the nation?**

Us.  Me.   


So read on to see how our household is moving forward!

## The U.S. Metric Timeline

Because many American's, like my peers abroad did not even know Metric was _a thing_ in the U.S.

> did not know the US had even cast their eyes on metric at all let alone had made some moves toward trying to shift to it

**But we did, we have, er we've tried?**

- 1866: Congress authorizes metric system, and even gives set of standard weights and measures to every state.
- 1875: U.S. is one of first 17 signatures of "Treat of the Meter" (a.k.a. Metric Convention) 
- 1893: Metric was adopted as "the fundamental standard" and imperial measures (pound, foot, etc) are now defined in reference to the kilogram, meter, etc.
- 1968: Congress authorizes 3 year study to feasibility of full conversion to metric. The study concluded it was not only possible, but inevitable.
- 1975: Congress passes the "Metric Conversion Act of 1975", however a 10 year conversion period was scrapped, and encouraged "voluntary conversion." Those efforts were largely ignored by American public.
- 1981: The "Metric Board" came back to Congress to admit defeat, success would require a Congressional mandate.
- 1982: Rather than make said mandate, Congress just dropped the comittees efforts and disestablished the Metric Board.
- 1988: As part of "Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988", Congress amends the 1975 act, stating metric as "preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce."
- 1992: The deadline for all U.S. Agencies to use the metric system in their procurement, grants and other business related activities.  Not required of private sector, it was intended to be catalyst for conversion within the country's commerce.
- 2021: NIST is the only US agency to use metric consistently and most American's have no idea how to use the metric system, and could not give an accurate metric estimate to save thier life.

## The U.S. Household

Ok, so as we know U.S. Congress is inept, and will never pass any law that slightly inconviences industry.  So this U.S. Family is taking it upon ourselves to learn, adopt, and evangalize the international system of measure!

## Join Us (the world..)

If you're looking to jump-start your adoption of metric and standard measures, I am including some found and created resources to help my family see, size, estimate, write and speak in metric measures!



### Talking Temp

The easiest way to expose in our daily lives.  25F is a cold winter day, but 25C is a great day for the beach.  Encourage your family to convert F to C wherever you see it. (bank signs, smart phones, news reports, etc)

We're not treating this as "conversion" but just a high level mapping. Not getting specifically accurate, but generally close (cold, warm, hot).

I didn't want to start with conversions because my children 3 & 5 are too young for quick maths, and ideally young enough to just start with metric as their baseline.


### Estimate Everything

How much does that car weigh?  How long is that bridge? How much milk in your cup?  Use everyday objects to discuss estimating size in metric.

### NIST

National Institute of Standards and Technology has an entire site dedicsted to Metric measures and adopttion, including videos, reading materials and even experiments.
