Your welcome. What is the Julygustember 2010 DreamHost Newsletter? You ask? Well, I am surprised you're not acting on that lucrative deal, but I'll explain regardless. Each month-ish DreamHost sends out a friendly newsletter updating customers on the most recent data center upgrades, one-click installs, or other upgrades and perks. This months was another multi-month catch-up, hence the name. But as usual, worth the delay.  Good things coking, and plenty of humor:

> DreamHost, unlike most hosts, provides technical support for popular third party applications.  When you contact our talented technical support team with a WordPress or phpBB question they'll provide you with all the links and hand-holding you need to get your problems resolved. Most of the hosting industry is, unfortunately, not so generous. It's not because they don't like *you* - you're great, honestly.  I mean those eyes, those legs...UNNH.  You've got it going on.
