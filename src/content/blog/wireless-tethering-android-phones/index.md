As many of you already know, Google announed during their second IO Keynote on Thursday that the latest version of **Android** (2.2 - Froyo) to start shipping will **include WiFi tethering** \- or hotspots. This feature **allows you to share your mobile phone's connection with any nearby computer** \- and its completely legit Phone carriers can be none to pleased, as **makers like [Sprint already include a hotspot option on their latest EVO](http://evounlocked.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=12 "Sprint Hotspot on the JHTC Evo - pictures and more"), but charge extra for the feature**. Since I was fortunate enough to attend Google IO i received [the new **EVO**](http://now.sprint.com/evo/?id9=SEM_Google_P_Sprint_HTC "Visit Sprint site to pre-order the EVO now") along with its 30 day trial of Sprint's service.Â  I must say that I am in love, but paying ~$80 a month for one phone and data is just too much.. Maybe I will share the phone with a loyal reader after my plan expires next month..
