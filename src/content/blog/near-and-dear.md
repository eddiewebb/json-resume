Elmo and Moxie")](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dscf0677.jpg) Alison Rendinaro is my beautiful girlfriend of many years. Her passion is in the education system of our country. She is now working towards her Masters in Public Administration.

### My Dog

  
This is my dog, Dioji (D-O-G). She has been my close companion since I found her abandoned on a friend's farm many years ago. A little roughed up she took some time to relax. Now several years later her nurturing and passive spirit is enjoyed most by my niece of 2 years.
