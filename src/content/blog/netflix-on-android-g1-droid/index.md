I wrote a month or two ago about my [**Android application for Netflix subscribers**](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/site-news/netflix-queue-manager-android-phones "Netflix application for Android"). The application allows users to **fully manage their instant and disc queues, browse recommendations and search all titles**. The reason then for this post is to share an update and gloat a bit. QueueMan has a whole bunch of new features, has been downloaded nearly 5,000 times (Update: Over 10,000 times!), is tested and proven on **Motorola's Droid** platform, and is getting quite positive reviews compared to other Netflix apps on the market.   Oh yeah - and it's all open source - Booyah!  The first release of QueueMan was.. well wimpy to be honest - but it did the trick for me.  Since then I have received lots of enhancement requests from Netflix users, and I am happy to report I have implemented a good number of those.

### Latest Features

*   Browse Recommendations
*   Rate any title
*   view at home discs (and rate!)
*   Default Tab (queue) setting
*   Support for Droid, Eris and others

### Praise for Netflix Application
