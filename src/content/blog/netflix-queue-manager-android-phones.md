QueueMan the Open Source Netflix queue management tool for Android Devices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

QueueMan aims to be the Open Source **Android** application for **Netflix** subscribers. And it has already gotten some [great reviews](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/site-news/netflix-queue-manager-android-phones#Best_netflix_app_on_the_market!_"Netflix_reccomends"_c "Reviews for Netflix application on Android"). \[caption id="attachment_628" align="aligncenter" width="256" caption="Netflix application for Android devices (Nexus One, G1, Droid, Eris, others)"\][![Netflix application for Android devices (G1, Droid, Eris, others)](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/red_bug.png "QueueMan icon")](https://blog.edwardawebb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/red_bug.png)\[/caption\] Isn't it adorable!

### Features

*   View current Disc and Instant queues
*   **Search Netflix catalog and Add new movies to Instant and DVD Queues**
*   Re-order or delete existing movies
*   View movie details (Year, rating, Synopsis, etc)

### Hot Announcement!

11/11/09 - **QueueMan** told me how it was, and **he wants to be an open source droid**. Well as a lowly developer I am in no position to argue.  Please checkout [QueueMan's new home on Google Project Hosting](http://code.google.com/p/queueman/ "QueueMan project page on Google Project Hosting."). QueueMan is now licensed under the [GPL version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt "Read the full GPL as plain text").

### QueueMan is a Beta Release

I think I have done a decent job of eliminating most bugs, but testing on an emulator and one developer device is hardly thorough, so **your testing and development contributions are greatly appreciated!** **QueueMan wants to be your tool of choice for managing your Netflix Queue**.   Users of Roku and XBox to watch instant movies will appreciate the ability to **add movies to your instant Queue right form the couch**! Conventional home delivery users will appreciate the ability to hold off that drab documentary and add a peppy holiday film to the top of your Queue. **Best of all, everyone should appreciate his new Open Source swagger, he knows that with the free collaboration this provides he'll be king of the hill in no time**.
