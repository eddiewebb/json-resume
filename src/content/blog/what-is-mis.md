First things first, **MIS is not IS**, the M does have a meaning. The degree is a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration. The M is management courses. MIS is a degree aimed to meet the expanding needs of business today. An MIS graduate has experience and knowledge in both **business theory** and **practical technology** solutions. Coursework ranges from _Database Theory and Design_ right up to _Project Management_ and _Managerial Accounting_. Required communication courses build communication and interpersonal skills while a **required 900 hours of actual field work** (co-op) provide real-world applications of the tools we learn.
