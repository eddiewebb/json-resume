That's right! I have decided to publicize **The GreenLife List** on a small basis in order to gain critical user feedback. I hope you'll visit [**The GreenLife List**](http://thegreenlifelist.org "Open The GreenLife List in a new window to begin browsing."), register an account, add some products and generally test-drive the site. I also hope you'll follow up that visit by dropping us a note on the contact page, or passing along your results here as a comment. The site provides us (consumers) with a quick and easy way to evaluate products and the companies producing them.

### Evaluate, how?

- Human Rights

*   Paying living wages is a requirement for survival, not an area to cut costs.

- Sustainability

*   Beyond planting trees, every resource needs to be evaluated for sustainable use in the long term.

- Philanthropy

*   What better use of profits than benefiting the community that provides your workers and wealth?

I feel, as many others do, that the cost of creating sustainable products are inherent in business, and we don't want to hear excuses. Companies can and should produce under stricter guidelines, but **we (the consumers) must be the one to impose and enforce those guidelines. There is no greater power than citizen action.** So by purchasing products that comply, and avoiding those that don't, we can send a very clear method. **Low profits are better than NO profits, and non-sustainable products will not bring profit from us or any responsible consumer. We want responsible corporations to realize these costs as inherent parts of business in today's economy.** So I'll get off my soapbox now and leave it to you, but I leave you with this.. "The world is run by those who show up"
