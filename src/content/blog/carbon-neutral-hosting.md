Not only does my recent move to DreamHost mean that I finally get the flexibility and features I need in a webhost, but it also means your viewing a site hosted on Carbon Neutral servers. Woot-Woot!  
I jumped at the chance to boast a bit with a simple icon you'll notice at the footing of all my pages. [![Green Web Hosting! This site hosted by DreamHost.](https://secure.newdream.net/green3.gif "Green Web Hosting! This site hosted by DreamHost.")](https://secure.newdream.net/green3.gif)  
If you want to go green with your sites, or just need a decent host I strongly recommend them. Why are they green? [http://www.dreamhost.com/aboutus-green.html](http://www.dreamhost.com/aboutus-green.html)
