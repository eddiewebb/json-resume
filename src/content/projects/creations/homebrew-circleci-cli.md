# Homebrew wrapper for CircleCI CLI

The official CLI from CircleCI](https://github.com/circleci/local-cli) wraps a docker execution with some dynamic versioning/updating support.  Self-updating formula is a no-no for Homebrew, but Homebrew install for CircleCI has been requested.

This formula is maintained by Eddie to mirror official CLI features using official CircleCI images.
