Our software teams use Maven heavily, and it was reported to my central platforms team that certain failed operations were leaking our SCM passwords.  Digging in I was able to find the cause in the underlying Maven SCM plugin used by Maven Release Plugin.

```
[ERROR] fatal: unable to access 'https://myuser:mypassword@myserver.com/scm/project/project.git/'
```

I contrubuted a fix that masked the pattern known to nbe passwords, providing test cases to validate that future leaks would not regress into the code base.
